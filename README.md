# Forme

Forme explores a controllable digital counterpart that extends an entity across **Continuity, Cognition, Agency, and Presence** without taking away the owner's authorship.

The August 12 MVP is a **Living Project Twin** for one real project. It must remember where the project is, notice what it is becoming, act once within an explicit and reversible trust boundary, and produce one controlled collaborator projection.

## Current state

This repository is an owner-controlled rebuild started on 2026-07-17.

- MVP complete and repeatable: **2026-08-11**
- Demo Day: **2026-08-12**
- Current gate: **R2 — Cognition Control Packet; implementation not yet approved**
- Product implementation: **R1 accepted** — deterministic Forme repo → durable Twin revision → Markdown Restart View

Planning lives in milestone [`MVP Rebuild — Demo 2026-08-12`](https://github.com/formehq/forme/milestone/11), parent epic [#47](https://github.com/formehq/forme/issues/47), completed R1 issue [#49](https://github.com/formehq/forme/issues/49), and next R2 issue [#50](https://github.com/formehq/forme/issues/50).

The previous implementation remains available at [`archive/v0-prototype-2026-07-17`](https://github.com/formehq/forme/tree/archive/v0-prototype-2026-07-17) and tag [`v0-prototype-final-2026-07-17`](https://github.com/formehq/forme/tree/v0-prototype-final-2026-07-17). It is a reference and parts library, not the default architecture.

## Read order

1. [`docs/PRODUCT.md`](./docs/PRODUCT.md) — highest vision, MVP vision, and scope
2. [`docs/CONTROL.md`](./docs/CONTROL.md) — current state, owner gates, and definition of done
3. [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](./docs/ROADMAP.md) — dates, slices, and cut rules
4. [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — initial system boundaries, not a frozen implementation
5. [`docs/DECISIONS.md`](./docs/DECISIONS.md) — short decision record

Repository work is tracked in GitHub. An issue is complete only after technical evidence and owner acceptance are both recorded.

## R1 Continuity — accepted 2026-07-18

R1 uses no model runtime and never writes project sources. It observes only an explicit allowlist, stores relative-path evidence metadata in project-local Git-ignored `.forme/` revisions, and renders a reconstructible Markdown view.

Requirements:

- Node.js 24 or newer
- npm
- Git

From a fresh checkout:

```sh
npm ci
npm run check

npm run forme -- init \
  --workspace . \
  --name "Forme" \
  --intent "Build and owner-accept the deterministic R1 Continuity slice for the Forme MVP." \
  --next "Run the restart-safe Forme repo demo and review the generated Restart View." \
  --include "README.md,AGENTS.md,package.json,package-lock.json,src,schemas,test,docs/PRODUCT.md,docs/CONTROL.md,docs/ROADMAP.md,docs/ARCHITECTURE.md,docs/DECISIONS.md"
```

After an allowlisted source change:

```sh
npm run forme -- observe --workspace .
npm run forme -- status --workspace .
```

The owner can update the project frame through the same observation command:

```sh
npm run forme -- observe --workspace . \
  --intent "Keep the current project intent owner-controlled." \
  --next "Review the reconstructed Restart View." \
  --unresolved "Should R2 add Codex?,Should R2 add OpenCode?"
```

Owner Frame options replace the supplied field; omitted fields keep their current values. Unknown or misplaced CLI options fail instead of being silently ignored.

The owner view is `.forme/restart.md`. Deleting that derived file and running `status` reconstructs it from the latest validated revision selected by `.forme/HEAD`.
